# burgerland

Solution for the Burger Land booking task.

The code here is a stub that shows certain features of the product only.

In the repo are two diagrams:

- [Architecture diagram](/architecture.png) - high level overview of the necessary infrastructure
- [Booking flow diagram](/booking-flow.png) - visual representation of the user journey to book tickets etc.

## Decisions

### Remix

This app is built with [Remix](https://remix.run/docs), a framework for React.

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
